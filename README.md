# My_vim_configuration
This is an unprofessional work.
The purpose is sharing with everybody who wants to approach to the vim world, my vimrc with 
all the plugins that I installed and the key remaps that I have made.

## Build instructions <a name="Installation"></a>
Unfortunately, I couldn't upload my ".vim" folder because it is too heavy but I will write
everything you need to install everything.
1. Download the vimrc file and put it into your home directory, remembering to save it as
   an hidden file so: ".vimrc".
   Inside the vimrc file there is the configuration of your vim, so you will find some 
   instructions that are built-in and you are simply activating them, seemingly there are
   some key remap and then plugins. Plugins help you improve your vim experience eventhough
   I suggest to study vim deeply to see what it can do on its own, you will see that 
   a lot of things are built-in and so you don't need a plugin.

2. Create a directory inside your home named ".vim" then inside it another two named:
   "undodir" and "bundle"
